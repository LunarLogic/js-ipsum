# JS Ipsum - put some JavaScript into your mockups

JS Ipsum is a random text generator. It takes real JavaScript buzzwords definitions from [JS Jargon](https://github.com/HugoGiraudel/SJSJ) and mixes them in unexpected ways that will make you laugh and cry inside (at the same time). You can use this text as a placeholder instead of a regular Lorem Ipsum text.

# JS Ipsum official page

Play with JavaScript buzzwords on [official JS Ipsum page](http://jsipsum.lunarlogic.io/).

# Installation

To run JS Ipsum locally you need to have Ruby 2.3.1 with Bundler installed. 

``sh
bundle install
unicorn
``

After running this in the project repository you should be able to see the JS Ipsum page at http://localhost:8080/.
