JavaScript AST, Semantics

WebAssembly - W3C cross-browser collaboration on a new, portable, size- and load-time-efficient format suitable for compilation to the web.
Closure Compiler AST Documentation
SpiderMonkey Parser API - see also reflect.js above. The AST interface specification is succeeded by the ESTree specification effort.
